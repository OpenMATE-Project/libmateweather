	* configure.in: post-release bump to 2.26.2

==================== 2.26.1 ====================

2009-04-14  Vincent Untz  <vuntz@gnome.org>

	* configure.in:
	* NEWS: version 2.26.1

2009-03-23  Dan Winship  <danw@gnome.org>

	* libgweather/weather-wx.c (wx_start_open): don't crash if the
	user provided an invalid URL for the radar check. #575113

2009-03-16  Vincent Untz  <vuntz@gnome.org>

	* configure.in: post-release bump to 2.26.1

==================== 2.26.0 ====================

2009-03-16  Vincent Untz  <vuntz@gnome.org>

	* configure.in:
	* NEWS: version 2.26.0

2009-03-14  Vincent Untz  <vuntz@gnome.org>

	* doc/tmpl/weather.sgml: template has changed a bit because of some
	minor tweaks during this cycle.

2009-03-04  Dan Winship  <danw@gnome.org>

	* data/Locations.xml.in: Regenerate again with KVDW; yesterday's
	fix didn't completely fix the string freeze break.

2009-03-03  Dan Winship  <danw@gnome.org>

	* data/Locations.xml.in: Regenerate after adding KBRX (Bordeaux,
	Wyoming, USA) back to the observations list, because if we remove
	it then Bordeaux, France is no longer ambiguous, so it loses its
	msgctxt, which means its existing translation goes fuzzy, which
	breaks string freeze. See #573969 for discussion of an eventual
	real fix.

2009-03-03  Dan Winship  <danw@gnome.org>

	* data/city-fixups.pl: Remove a duplicate copy of Warsaw. #563496.

	* data/station-fixups.pl: Strip out the automated Canadian
	stations that (badly) duplicate non-automated stations. Among
	other things, fixes Edmonton, #573936.

	* data/Locations.xml.in: Regen for the preceding changes, and
	using a new observations file containing the intersection of the
	2.24 locations and the currently-reporting locations. Among other
	things, this gets rid of the now-defunct Berlin Templehof station,
	fixing the weather in Berlin. #567607.

	* configure.in: post-release bump to 2.26.0

	Unknown for translation, with context.
	* libgweather/weather-priv.h: add C_() (and gweather_dpgettext())
	* libgweather/weather.c: (gweather_gettext_init): new inline function,
	based on code from gweather_gettext()
	(gweather_gettext): use gweather_gettext_init()

==================== 2.25.91 ====================

2009-02-17  Vincent Untz  <vuntz@gnome.org>

	* configure.in:
	* NEWS: version 2.25.91

2009-02-17  Vincent Untz  <vuntz@gnome.org>

	* data/Locations.xml.in: use Asia/Kathmandu instead of Asia/Katmandu
	(change in tzdata 2009a)

==================== 2.25.4 ====================

2009-01-06  Vincent Untz  <vuntz@gnome.org>

	* configure.in:
	* NEWS: version 2.25.4

2008-12-19  Milan Crha  <mcrha@redhat.com>

	** Part of fix for bug #564652

	* libgweather/weather-iwin.c:
	* libgweather/gweather-xml.h:
	* libgweather/gweather-xml.c:
	Do not copy soup session information for a forecast list. Check for
	a forecast list information even without 'zone' of a 'location'.
	Leak a bit less; new function 'gweather_xml_free_locations' to help
	with this.

2008-12-14  Vincent Untz  <vuntz@gnome.org>

	* configure.in: post-release bump to 2.25.4

==================== 2.25.3 ====================

2008-12-14  Vincent Untz  <vuntz@gnome.org>

	* configure.in:
	* NEWS: version 2.25.3

2008-12-02  Vincent Untz  <vuntz@gnome.org>

	Second part of win32 portability.
	Based on patch by Tor Lillqvist <tml@iki.fi>
	Needed for bug #352287.

	* configure.in: detect win32
	* doc/Makefile.am: ignore gweather-win32.h
	* libgweather/Makefile.am: hack stuff for win32
	* libgweather/gweather-win32.[ch]: new, some black magic win32 changes
	to get the right directories
	* libgweather/gweather-timezone.c:
	* libgweather/weather-metar.c:
	* libgweather/weather-sun.c:
	* libgweather/weather.c: include gweather-win32.h on win32

2008-12-02  Vincent Untz  <vuntz@gnome.org>

	* libgweather/weather.c: (temperature_string), (temperature_value):
	rename some variables for win32 portability.
	Based on patch by Tor Lillqvist <tml@iki.fi>
	First part needed for bug #352287.

2008-12-02  Vincent Untz  <vuntz@gnome.org>

	* configure.in: post-release bump to 2.25.3

==================== 2.25.2 ====================

2008-12-02  Vincent Untz  <vuntz@gnome.org>

	* configure.in:
	* NEWS: version 2.25.2

2008-12-02  Vincent Untz  <vuntz@gnome.org>

	* data/locations.dtd: update for msgctxt

2008-11-30  Dan Winship  <danw@gnome.org>

	* data/update-locations.py (get_city): Prefer a city name with no
	language tag to one with, since that seems to mean "international
	name". Fixes "Macau". #558310,  Leonardo Ferreira Fontenelle.

	* data/update-locations.py: Fix the logic around assuming that
	cities are located in the same state as their weather station;
	obviously this doesn't apply when they're in different countries.
	Fixes a bug that previously caused Luxembourg (the city) to end up
	in Belgium rather than Luxembourg (the country). #562772

	* data/Locations.xml.in: regen

2008-11-27  Vincent Untz  <vuntz@gnome.org>

	* libgweather/weather.c:
	(weather_wind_direction_string), (weather_sky_string),
	(weather_conditions_string), (weather_info_get_icon_name),
	(weather_info_get_value_sky), (weather_info_get_value_conditions),
	(weather_info_get_value_wind), (weather_info_get_value_visibility):
	have clearer & saner checks for validity of enum values.
	(weather_location_new), (_weather_internal_check): internal consistency
	checks
	* libgweather/weather.h: add new enum values for LAST and INVALID
	Fix bug #562283.

2008-11-25  Dan Winship  <danw@gnome.org>

	* libgweather/gweather-location.c:
	(gweather_location_get_children)
	(gweather_location_free_children): Make the memory-management here
	less lame. #562274

	* libgweather/gweather-timezone.c:
	* libgweather/location-entry.c:
	* libgweather/timezone-menu.c: Add some docs. #562261

	* doc/Makefile.am (IGNORE_HFILES): set this

	* doc/libgweather-sections.txt: update

	* doc/libgweather-docs.sgml: fix (some)

2008-11-26  Vincent Untz  <vuntz@gnome.org>

	* Makefile.am:
	* configure.in:
	* doc/*: add gtk-doc setup. First step for bug #562261.

2008-11-26  Vincent Untz  <vuntz@gnome.org>

	* libgweather/gweather-gconf.c:
	* libgweather/gweather-location.c:
	* libgweather/gweather-prefs.c:
	* libgweather/gweather-timezone.c:
	* libgweather/timezone-menu.c:
	* libgweather/weather-sun.c:
	* libgweather/weather.c:
	Add some safety guards with g_return[_val]_if_fail() to public API.
	Hopefully, I did it right. I guess people will notice quickly if it's
	not the case ;-)

2008-11-25  Vincent Untz  <vuntz@gnome.org>

	* libgweather/gweather-xml.c: (gweather_xml_parse_node): remove unused
	variable
	* libgweather/weather-iwin.c: (iwin_finish), (iwin_start_open):
	correctly format code

2008-11-25  Vincent Untz  <vuntz@gnome.org>

	* configure.in: use $DISABLE_DEPRECATED which is set by gnome-common
	instead of listing _DISABLE_DEPRECATED flags ourselves. We'll stay
	up-to-date this way. Note: use gnome-common from trunk if you want
	LIBSOUP_DISABLE_DEPRECATED really hard.
	* libgweather/gweather-uninstalled.pc.in: remove locations_file from
	there too

2008-11-25  Dan Winship  <danw@gnome.org>

	* data/update-locations.py: when given a location name like
	"Covington / Cincinnati", only create an entry for one of the two
	cities (the larger one if we can tell, the one closer to the
	weather station if we can't) rather than creating a separate entry
	for each.

	* data/Locations.xml.in: regen

2008-11-25  Vincent Untz  <vuntz@gnome.org>

	* configure.in: add --enable-locations-compression to compress the
	Locations.xml files.
	* data/Makefile.am: compress data files if requested.
	* libgweather/parser.c: (gweather_parser_new): look for .gz files too.
	Thanks to libxml2, we don't have to do anything to support compressed
	files.
	Fix bug #552868.

2008-11-25  Dan Winship  <danw@gnome.org>

	* configure.in (IT_PROG_INTLTOOL): require 0.40.3, for msgctxt
	support

	* data/update-locations.py: find duplicate names, and add msgctxt
	attributes to the XML so that, eg, translators can differentiate
	"Athens, Georgia, USA" from the capital of Greece and the former
	Soviet republic. #529057
	(State.__init__, City.print_xml, get_city): trim down the text of
	the comments. In particular, we don't need to prepend
	"Translators: ..." to them, because *all* of the comments in
	Locations.xml.in are for translators.

	* data/Locations.xml.in: regen

	* data/Makefile.am (rebuild-locations): fix this rule to delete
	the right file on error

2008-11-25  Dan Winship  <danw@gnome.org>

	Don't worry about sub-city locations; people generally aren't
	going to know which of the locations is closest to them, and the
	weather reports from all of them should be basically the same
	anyway.

	* data/update-locations.py (Location.print_xml): never use <_name>
	for location-level names; always just use <name> so they don't get
	localized
	(observations_url): add a hack to let you override the
	recent-observations file, so you can regenerate Locations.xml.in
	without changing the set of active stations
	(Country.__init__): add "Bahamas" to the list of countries whose
	name we put "the" before in comments

	* data/Locations.xml.in: regen, dropping localization for
	<location> nodes

	* libgweather/gweather-xml.c (gweather_xml_parse_node): Remove the
	cities-with-multiple-locations code, and just make all cities use
	their first child location. Also, ignore <location>s that aren't
	children of <city>s (which should be impossible now anyway).

	* libgweather/location-entry.c (fill_location_entry_model):
	likewise

2008-11-25  Dan Winship  <danw@gnome.org>

	* libgweather/gweather.pc.in (locations_file): remove this; we do
	not support other programs reading the locations file directly,
	you have to use the libgweather API.

2008-11-25  Dan Winship  <danw@gnome.org>

	* configure.in: Add -DG_DISABLE_SINGLE_INCLUDES and
	-DGTK_DISABLE_SINGLE_INCLUDES. Also add various
	_DISABLE_DEPRECATED flags in maintainer mode. Fix a dumb bug where
	we weren't setting GTK_CFLAGS or LIBXML_CFLAGS.

	* libgweather/gweather-gconf.c:
	* libgweather/weather.c:
	* libgweather/weather.h: only use single includes. Patch from
	Maxim Ermilov, #560794.

	* libgweather/weather-wx.c (wx_start_open): Use
	soup_message_body_set_accumulate() rather than the deprecated
	SOUP_MESSAGE_OVERWRITE_CHUNKS flag.

2008-11-25  Dan Winship  <danw@gnome.org>

	* configure.in: check for libsoup-gnome-2.4 >= 2.25.1 and set
	HAVE_LIBSOUP_GNOME if found. Otherwise fall back to libsoup-2.4.
	(The fallback is a temporary convenience thing so we don't require
	libsoup trunk so early in the release cycle.)

	* libgweather/weather.c: remove the http proxy lookup code, and
	instead just use SoupProxyResolverGNOME when HAVE_LIBSOUP_GNOME.
	Fixes #393168 (gweather retrieval fails with automatic proxy
	config) and #344964 (Weather Report does not reload changed proxy
	configuration).

2008-11-25  Dan Winship  <danw@gnome.org>

	* COPYING: add a copy of GPLv2 so that automake doesn't add a copy
	of GPLv3. #561887

2008-11-25  Dan Winship  <danw@gnome.org>

	* libgweather/weather-metar.c (WIND_RE_STR, metar_tok_wind):
	Handle wind reports in m/s. #541721

2008-11-25  Dan Winship  <danw@gnome.org>

	* libgweather/weather.c (temperature_string): Use the degree sign
	followed by "C" or "F" rather than using the combined "degrees C"
	and "degrees F" glyphs, which aren't available in some fonts, and
	look bad in others. #526437

	* libgweather/test_metar.c (main): tweak this a little to test
	that change

2008-11-25  Milan Crha <mcrha@redhat.com>

	** Fix for bug #538787

	* libgweather/weather.h:
	* libgweather/weather.c:
	* libgweather/weather-iwin.c:
	Extending API to be able to get WeatherInfo values as numbers.

2008-11-25  Dan Winship  <danw@gnome.org>

	* configure.in: post-branch bump to 2.25.1

	* python/Makefile.am: try to fix distcheck

2008-10-17  Dan Winship  <danw@gnome.org>

	* libgweather/weather.c (weather_info_network_error): Add this so
	we can distinguish "the requested code was invalid" from "we
	couldn't access the METAR site". Needed for #556776

	* libgweather/weather-metar.c (metar_finish): set network_error if
	the soup request gets a "transport error" status code, or if it
	gets back an HTML page that looks like it didn't come from the
	METAR server.

2008-10-17  Dan Winship  <danw@gnome.org>

	* libgweather/Makefile.am (libgweather_la_LIBADD): add -lm.
	#551215, Frederic Peters.

	* libgweather/gweather.pc.in: move -lm from Libs to Libs.private

	* libgweather/gweather-location.h: remove unused types. #546317

	* libgweather/gweather-timezone.c (gweather_timezones_parse_xml):
	don't return NULL (and cause a crash) if a timezone name is
	unrecognized; just ignore that timezone. Part of #553838.

	* libgweather/weather.c (weather_session_new): new utility to
	create a SoupSession, using the GConf proxy settings. Sort of
	addresses #552580.

2008-10-14  Dan Winship  <danw@gnome.org>

	* data/Locations.xml.in: The Mexican states of Chihuahua, Nayarit,
	Sinaloa, and Sonora are in Mountain Time, not Central Time.
	#556322, Christopher Aillon.

2008-09-29  Dan Winship  <danw@gnome.org>

	* python/Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): dist gweather.defs (and move
	EXTRA_DIST outside the if ENABLE_PYTHON). #554086, Emilio Pozuelo
	Monfort.

2008-09-29  Dan Winship  <danw@gnome.org>

	* libgweather/weather.c (gweather_gettext): gettext wrapper that
	ensures bindtextdomain() and bind_textdomain_codeset() have been
	called for our GETTEXT_PACKAGE.

	* libgweather/weather-priv.h: Prototype gweather_gettext, #define
	_() in terms of it.

	* libgweather/gweather-gconf.c:
	* libgweather/gweather-prefs.c:
	* libgweather/weather-iwin.c:
	* libgweather/weather-metar.c:
	* libgweather/weather-wx.c: Remove glib/gi18n-lib.h includes, add

2008-09-08  Vincent Untz  <vuntz@gnome.org>

	* configure.in:
	* NEWS: version 2.23.92

2008-09-04  Dan Winship  <danw@gnome.org>

	* python/*: create python bindings for GWeatherLocation,
	GWeatherTimezone, GWeatherLocationEntry, and GWeatherTimezoneMenu.
	As with the C library, these are unstable. #547824

	* configure.in: Add --enable-python (off by default)

	* acinclude.m4: stuff needed for that

2008-09-04  Dan Winship  <danw@gnome.org>

	Set libgweather up for bindings. Part of #547824

	* configure.in: set GLIB_MKENUMS

	* libgweather/Makefile.am: build gweather-enum-types.[ch]

	* libgweather/gweather-enum-types.c.tmpl:
	* libgweather/gweather-enum-types.h.tmpl: Add these

	* libgweather/gweather-location.c (gweather_location_get_type):
	* libgweather/gweather-timezone.c (gweather_timezone_get_type):
	register as boxed types

2008-09-03  Dan Winship  <danw@gnome.org>

	* libgweather/*.[ch]: Clean up the GPL notices and #includes.
	Remove most of the "Author: ..." comments since they're mostly
	wrong at this point anyway. The last remaining part of #538657.

	* AUTHORS: add this, containing just the original author of
	gweather applet, which is wrong, but it corresponds to what the .c
	files claimed previously, and we'll figure out who else to list
	later.

	* libgweather/gweather-location.c:
	* libgweather/gweather-location.h:
	* libgweather/gweather-timezone.c:
	* libgweather/gweather-timezone.h:
	* libgweather/location-entry.c:
	* libgweather/location-entry.h:

	* libgweather/timezone-menu.h: Add Copyright and fix license text
	to say LGPL rather than GPL; it doesn't really matter at this
	point since the rest of the library is still GPL, but it may be
	useful in the future.

2008-09-01  Vincent Untz  <vuntz@gnome.org>

	* configure.in: post-release bump to 2.23.92

==================== 2.23.91 ====================

2008-09-01  Vincent Untz  <vuntz@gnome.org>

	* configure.in:
	* NEWS: version 2.23.91

	* configure.in:
	* libgweather/Makefile.am:
	* libgweather/gweather-uninstalled.pc.in:
	Add a gweather-uninstalled.pc.in file.
	Based on patch by Damien Carbery <damien.carbery@sun.com>
	Fix bug #510125

2008-08-25  Dan Winship  <danw@gnome.org>

	* data/Locations.xml.in: fix cut+paste

2008-08-25  Dan Winship  <danw@gnome.org>

	* data/city-fixups.pl: Remove duplicate Bangkok, Thailand under a
	separate name. #548630.

	* data/station-fixups.pl: Fix typo in MMGL (Guadalajara, Mexico)
	#549047. Rename VTBD (Don Muang, Thailand) to "Bangkok" to avoid
	adding a useless extra entry (especially since that entry was
	buggy for another reason anyway). #548630.

	* data/Locations.xml.in: Regen. Adds the string "Guadalajara", but
	that was there in 2.22 so translations of it are already
	available.

	* data/Makefile.am (rebuild-locations, locationdb.sqlite): Fix;
	city-fixups.pl and station-fixups.pl changes require a locationdb
	rebuild, not just Locations.xml.in

2008-08-19  Vincent Untz  <vuntz@gnome.org>

	* configure.in: fix --with-zoneinfo-dir to actually work.
	Patch by Matt Keenan <matt.keenan@sun.com>.
	Fix bug #548440

2008-08-06  Dan Winship  <danw@gnome.org>

	* data/update-locations.py: Output <coordinates> using decimal
	degrees rather than converting them to degrees/minutes/seconds to
	write them to Locations.xml.in and then having libgweather
	immediately convert them back when it reads them in. (Also, the
	decimal form is easier to use with google maps, etc.)

	* data/Locations.xml.in: regen (only <coordinates> changed)

	* libgweather/gweather-location.c (parse_coordinates): parse
	decimal degrees rather than d/m/s.

2008-08-05  Dan Winship  <danw@gnome.org>

	* data/build-locationdb.pl: Mark PPLA ("state capital") cities as
	importance 1, not importance 2 (meaning we won't create <city>
	entries for them automatically). Importance=2 worked well for some
	countries, but for most countries it just ends up creating a whole
	lot of cruft.

	* data/update-locations.py: Fix a regexp to not mangle the spacing
	around "/" in some cases.
	(LocBase.__init__, LocBase.print_xml): Handle <timezones> when
	regenerating Locations.xml.in
	(Country.__init__, City.print_xml): Fix the comments on cities to
	insert "the" where needed. (eg, "a city in the United States",
	not "a city in United States").

	* data/Locations.xml.in: Regenerate, dropping 629 cities, changing
	a bunch of comments

        * libgweather/gweather-xml.c: (gweather_xml_parse_node):
	remove redundant semicolon that breaks the build with gcc 2
	(bug #546325)

2008-08-04  Vincent Untz  <vuntz@gnome.org>

	* configure.in: post-release bump to 2.23.90

==================== 2.23.6 ====================

2008-08-04  Vincent Untz  <vuntz@gnome.org>

	* configure.in:
	* NEWS: version 2.23.6

2008-08-04  Dan Winship  <danw@gnome.org>

	* libgweather/gweather-location.c
	(gweather_location_get_city_name): Make this work for cities too,
	not just <location>s.

	* libgweather/location-entry.c (fill_location_entry_model): fix
	the city-with-a-single-location case.

2008-08-04  Dan Winship  <danw@gnome.org>

	* configure.in (ZONEINFO_DIR): Figure out zoneinfo directory

	* libgweather/gweather-timezone.c: Use that rather than hardcoding
	/usr/share/zoneinfo

	* libgweather/gweather.pc.in: define datarootdir, to shut up an
	autoconf warning

2008-08-04  Dan Winship  <danw@gnome.org>

	* data/Locations.xml.in:
	* data/locations.dtd: add information about timezones

	* libgweather/parser.c: new Locations.xml.in parser

	* libgweather/gweather-location.c: opaque replacement for
	WeatherLocation, based on the new parser

	* libgweather/location-entry.c: Autocompleting location-selecting
	entry

	* libgweather/gweather-timezone.c: type representing a timezone

	* libgweather/timezone-menu.c: New widget for selecting
	a (localized) timezone.

	* libgweather/gweather-xml.c: use the new parser internally (but
	convert to WeatherLocation externally)

2008-08-03  Dan Winship  <danw@gnome.org>

	* data/Locations.xml.in: Regenerate this. Now every <location>
	node is inside a <city> node with a real city name, and the file
	can be regenerated easily as we get updated weather station lists.

	* data/build-locationdb.pl:
	* data/update-locations.py: the Locations.xml.in-rebuilding
	scripts. (Not yet in final form. Still need some refactoring and
	bugfixes...)

	* data/sources:
	* data/sources/README.sources: Directory to store the
	location/weather source files in, and a description of them

	* data/city-fixups.pl:
	* data/station-fixups.pl:
	* data/major-cities.txt: Additional scripts and data to "patch"
	the upstream data sources

	* data/check-observations.py: Script to get a list of currently-
	reporting weather stations

	* data/Makefile.am: add rebuild-locations rule

	* data/locations.dtd: update for schema changes

2008-07-30  Claude Paroz  <claude@2xlibre.net>

	* weather-metar.c: (metar_finish): Added translator comment.

2008-07-25  Matthias Clasen  <mclasen@redhat.com>

	* libgweather/weather*.c: Only increase pending_requests if 
	we actually queued request, else we may never call the finish_cb.
	Fixes weather information not showing up in the clock applet.

2008-07-22  Vincent Untz  <vuntz@gnome.org>

	* configure.in: post-release bump to 2.23.6

==================== 2.23.5 ====================

2008-07-22  Vincent Untz  <vuntz@gnome.org>

	* configure.in:
	* NEWS: version 2.23.5

2008-06-29  Dan Winship  <danw@gnome.org>

	* data/Locations.xml.in: Reorganize countries exactly according to
	ISO 3166; Move various territories/dependencies with their own ISO
	codes out into their own <country> nodes, and preemptively add
	nodes for the countries that we don't yet have weather stations
	for. Sync up a few names/accents with ISO 3166 and/or common
	English usage, and put a comment before each country giving the
	official name (plus notes in the cases that are confusing or
	non-obvious). #535518

	* data/locations.dtd: Allow empty countries; the code already just
	ignores them.

2008-06-29  Dan Winship  <danw@gnome.org>

	* data/Locations.xml.in (Serbia and Montenegro): Belatedly split
	"Serbia and Montenegro" into "Serbia" and "Montenegro".
	(EGYP, NIUE, NSTU, PMDY, PWAK, TKPN): Move each of these from the
	wrong <country> to the right one.
	(Bermuda): move from "Central and South America" to "Atlantic".
	(French Polynesia): move from "Central and South America" to
	"Australasia & Oceania"
	(CWWK, ESTA): Fix to use <_name> instead of <name>.
	(K3A1, K4A9, KAUO, KDCU, KDHN, KGZH, KMGM, KMSL, KOZR, KTCL, KTOI):
	Remove a bunch more locations that somehow got duplicated from
	Alabama into Arkansas (qv #425778 below).

2008-06-19  Vincent Untz  <vuntz@gnome.org>

	* libgweather/gweather.schemas.in: change references from cvs.gnome.org
	to svn.gnome.org. Patch by Jan Tichavský <Jan.Tichavsky@gmail.com>, fix
	bug #510619.

2008-06-18  Dan Winship  <danw@gnome.org>

	* libgweather/gweather-xml.c (gweather_xml_parse_node): When
	skipping an unrecognized node, use xmlTextReaderNext(), which
	properly handles skipping its children, making the parsing more
	future-proof. (The old code could only deal with skipping nodes
	containing only text.) Also, don't examine &iter if it hasn't been
	set (fixing a g_warning).

2008-06-18  Dan Winship  <danw@gnome.org>

	* data/Locations.xml.in: Misc updates from bugzilla:

	Fix spelling of Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. #383259, DULMANDAKH
	Sukhbaatar.

	Remove duplicate copy of Gadsden, Alabama, US, which had somehow
	snuck into Arkansas. #425778, Sebastian Bacher.

	Fix BOM codes for Alice Springs and Darwin, Australia. #492268,
	Andrew Burton.

	Reorganize Brazil into <state>s, with proper timezone hints.
	#528134, Grazieno Pellegrino.

	Fix South African locations to not be based on out-of-date airport
	names. #533622, Adrian Frith.

	Add Łódź, Poland (which has a weather station but does not appear
	in the METAR file). #534047, Marcin Banasiak.

2008-06-18  Dan Winship  <danw@gnome.org>

	* configure.in: require libsoup instead of gnome-vfs. (Also
	require gconf explicitly; it used to be pulled in implicitly by
	gnome-vfs.)

	* libgweather/weather-bom.c:
	* libgweather/weather-iwin.c:
	* libgweather/weather-met.c:
	* libgweather/weather-metar.c:
	* libgweather/weather-wx.c: Use libsoup rather than gnome-vfs for
	http. #527525

	* libgweather/Makefile.am:
	* libgweather/weather.c:
	* libgweather/weather-priv.h: update for libsoup changes

2008-06-18  Dan Winship  <danw@gnome.org>

	* libgweather/*.[ch]: code cleanup. Try to standardize on a single
	style. (No functional changes.)

	* libgweather/weather.c (dmsh2rad): s/toupper/g_ascii_toupper/

	* libgweather/weather-met.c (met_reprocess):
	s/isspace/g_ascii_isspace/. s/strncasecmp/g_ascii_strncasecmp/

2008-06-17  Vincent Untz  <vuntz@gnome.org>

	* Makefile.am: remove old intltool cruft

2008-06-04  Gabor Kelemen  <kelemeng@gnome.hu>

	* libgweather/weather.c: Address of the Weather Phenomena Matrix slightly changed (.html->.php)

2008-06-03  Vincent Untz  <vuntz@gnome.org>

	* configure.in: post-release bump to 2.23.4

2008-05-03  Callum McKenzie  <callum@spooky-possum.org>

	* data/Locations.xml.in: Added the East-Flanders region of
	Belgium, specifically Gent and Munte at the request of Tibault
	Damman (Bug #530932).

	* data/Locations.xml.in: Complete the entries for New Zealand
	(most are commented out until I figure out the correct local
	source of weather info). Move 'Williams Field, Antarctica' down to
	the Antarctica section and rename it to McMurdo Williams since
	there is already a Williams Field listing there (different METAR
	code). Move the Christmas/Cassidy entry from New Zealand to
	Kiribati, NOAA doesn't seem to understand the difference.

2008-04-21  Vincent Untz  <vuntz@gnome.org>

	* configure.in:
	* NEWS: version 2.23.2

==================== 2.23.1 ====================

2008-04-20  Jaap A. Haitsma  <jaap@haitsma.org>

	reviewed by: Vincent Untz

	Put coordinates for Santiago de Chile and Nefta in degrees, minutes,
	such that clock applet does not crash. Partly fixes bug #522689

2008-04-20  Dan Winship  <danw@gnome.org>

	* data/README.timezones: notes on the timezone hints in
	Locations.xml

2008-04-19  Vincent Untz  <vuntz@gnome.org>

	* libgweather/gweather-xml.c: (gweather_xml_parse_node):
	Remove useless entries (region/country/state/city without any
	location).
	When there's only one location in a city, merge the two items since
	it's kind of useless to display the child in this case.
	Fix bug #527594.

2008-04-18  Vincent Untz  <vuntz@gnome.org>

	* data/Makefile.am: make "make -jX" work. Fix bug #528359.

2008-04-18  Vincent Untz  <vuntz@gnome.org>

	* data/Makefile.am: fix build when $LINGUAS is set. Fix bug #528031.

	Mexico/BajaSur.

2008-04-14  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@novell.com>

	* data/Locations.xml.in: Fixed up Mexico - divide locations into
	states; add all missing state capitals.

2008-04-11  Vincent Untz  <vuntz@gnome.org>

	* data/Locations.xml.in: add some FIXME for later, when we can break
	strings.

2008-04-11  Vincent Untz  <vuntz@gnome.org>

	* libgweather/gweather.pc.in: add missing libraries in Requires and
	move some stuff to Requires.private

2008-04-10  Vincent Untz  <vuntz@gnome.org>

	* data/check-timezones.sh: portability fix to also work on Solaris

2008-04-10  Vincent Untz  <vuntz@gnome.org>

	Create a Locations.xml file per translation. This makes the parsing
	of the XML file much much faster (down to ~0.25s from ~1.5s for me).
	Also remove the spaces from the XML files (down from ~0.3s to ~0.25s).
	There is a configure flag to keep the old behavior:
	--enable-all-translations-in-one-xml

	* configure.in: add --enable-all-translations-in-one-xml configure flag
	* data/Makefile.am: pretty much rewrite to handle the new feature.
	Note that we don't distribute locations_diff.py anymore. It's mainly
	useful when hacking.
	* libgweather/Makefile.am: small update
	* libgweather/gweather-xml.c: (gweather_xml_load_locations): look for
	localized xml files first, and then fallback on Locations.xml

2008-04-10  Dan Winship  <danw@gnome.org>

	* data/Locations.xml.in: add FIXMEs to Brazil and Mexico, which
	need to be split up into states with per-state tz-hints, and
	Australia, Canada, and Greenland, which need minor fix-ups. Fix
	the timezones in DR Congo, Indonesia, and Kazakhstan myself since
	there are few enough cities listed for each that I could just
	Google them. Remove references to Asia/Kuching timezone in
	Malaysia since it has been identical to Asia/Kuala_Lumpur since
	1982 (pointed out by Ghee Teo). Fix various typos in tz-hints (and
	spell-check against zone.tab this time to make sure there are no
	more).

	* data/check-timezones.sh: timezone-checking script

	* data/Makefile.am (check): run check-timezones.sh

	* data/README: explain Locations.xml.in some

2008-04-08  Vincent Untz  <vuntz@gnome.org>

	Fix bug #526975

2008-04-08  Nickolay V. Shmyrev  <nshmyrev@yandex.ru>

	Winship <danw@gnome.org>. Fix bug #525451.

	those sub-country regions that have them). Add guesses at the
	timezones for various countries, states, and locations.
	* data/locations.dtd: Update; a country must have an iso-code, and
	a location may have one. A country, state, or location may have a
	tz-hint.
	* libgweather/gweather-xml.c (gweather_xml_parse_node): Handle iso-code
	and tz-hint (and make them be inherited properly).
	* libgweather/weather.[ch] (weather_location_new): add country_code and
	tz_hint fields to WeatherLocation and update its methods

2008-04-07  Vincent Untz  <vuntz@gnome.org>

	Fix bug #526015.

	* configure.in: find libxml libs/cflags

	and fix the XML parser to skip over unrecognized close tags as well as
	unrecognized open tags
